Hey there! 👋

This is where I share the UI components I've built for my projects,
along with some interesting and challenging animations I've recreated from [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/).
Everything here is crafted with best practices in mind, focusing on **GSAP** and vanilla JS/CSS - I'm just not a fan of "motion" (at least for now). All components are responsive and ready to drop into your projects.

## Components

<Components max={9} sortByCreatedTime="asc"/>

## How to Use

I publish all components following the **shadcn registry ecosystem**. If you're already using shadcn, this will feel right at home. Just grab what you need and go.

For those working on other platforms like **Webflow**, **Framer**, or similar -
you'll find an <span className="pointer-events-none inline-block translate-y-2"><OpenInV0Button/></span> button on each component. This deploys a live example in v0 where you can ask AI to customize it to fit your exact needs.
